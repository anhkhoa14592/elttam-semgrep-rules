  - id: Potential symlink takeover with os.Executable
    message: >-
      os.Executable()s behaviour varies between operating systems.
      On Linux symlinks are followed, while on MacOS and Windows they are not.
      Depending on context, this could lead to file replacement attacks and local privilege escalation.
